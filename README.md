# N-Body Simulation

This is a N-body simulation program that simulates the gravitational interaction between many bodies in space. The implementation of this simulation is divided into two approaches: The [Brute Force Algorithm](./brute-force/), a straightforward approach, yet computationally expensive, and the [Barnes Hut Algorithm](./barnes-hut/), a more efficient approach that uses a quadtree data structure to reduce the number of calculations, making it suitable for larger simulations.
