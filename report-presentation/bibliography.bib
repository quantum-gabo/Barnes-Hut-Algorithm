    abstract = {The numerical simulations of massive collisional stellar systems, such as globular clusters (GCs), are very time consuming. Until now, only a few realistic million-body simulations of GCs with a small fraction of binaries (\$5\{\{\\ \\rm per\\ cent\}\}\$) have been performed by using the nbody6++gpu code. Such models took half a year computational time on a Graphic Processing Unit (GPU)-based supercomputer. In this work, we develop a new N-body code, petar, by combining the methods of Barnes–Hut tree, Hermite integrator and slow-down algorithmic regularization. The code can accurately handle an arbitrary fraction of multiple systems (e.g. binaries and triples) while keeping a high performance by using the hybrid parallelization methods with mpi, openmp, simd instructions and GPU. A few benchmarks indicate that petar and nbody6++gpu have a very good agreement on the long-term evolution of the global structure, binary orbits and escapers. On a highly configured GPU desktop computer, the performance of a million-body simulation with all stars in binaries by using petar is 11 times faster than that of nbody6++gpu. Moreover, on the Cray XC50 supercomputer, petar well scales when number of cores increase. The 10 million-body problem, which covers the region of ultracompact dwarfs and nuclear star clusters, becomes possible to be solved.},

abstract = {Tungsten, as the most refractory metal, is applied in fusion reactor in parts subjected to high temperatures and strong neutron irradiation. These factors lead to intense diffusion processes causing degradation of the material. Experimental investigations under such conditions are usually highly complicated and cannot provide a comprehensive understanding of the occurring phenomena. Therefore, their combination with theoretical approaches is required. One of the most robust approaches to simulate diffusion processes is molecular dynamics simulations based on classical interatomic potentials. It allows modeling relatively large samples consisting of several grains, grain boundaries, dislocations, and other types of defects for a reasonable computational time. The reliable simulations of the diffusion process require interatomic potentials satisfying the following criteria: prediction of melting point and thermal expansion as close as possible to the experimental values because the diffusion coefficient strongly depends on the homologous temperature and size factor. In the present paper, we present the new interatomic potential for tungsten, developed within the N-body approach, which reproduces the experimental value of melting temperature (3695 K) and thermal expansion at temperatures up to a melting point. The calculated diffusion coefficient demonstrates adequate agreement with experimental results. The constructed potential is applicable for simulation of processes involving diffusion, one of which is the irradiation damage.}
